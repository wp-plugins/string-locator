Scan through theme and plugin files looking for text strings

== Description ==

When working on themes and plugins you often notice a piece of text that appears hardcoded into the files, you need to modify it, but you don't know where it's located in the theme files.

Easily search through your themes or plugins and be presented with a list of files, the matched text and what line of the file matched your search.
You can then quickly make edits to the file using the built in editor in WordPress by clicking the quick access links included with the search results.

1. Upload the `string-locator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
